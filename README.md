)
func main()
    plug, err := plugin.Open("/opi-marvell-bridge.so")
    feNvmeSymbol, err := plug.Lookup("PluginFrontendNvme")
    var feNvme pb.FrontendNvmeServiceServer
    feNvme, ok := feNvmeSymbol.(pb.FrontendNvmeServiceServer)
    s := grpc.NewServer()
    pb.RegisterFrontendNvmeServiceServer(s, feNvme)
    reflection.Register(s)
